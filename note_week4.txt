compare programs written in D with programs written in Ada 

-- compare performance 
-- performance evaluation of the ATC methods. 
-- way to do well in the report. 

-- structure of the report, and begin to write the bits that I have got. 
-- once i've got that, see what other room there is in the report. 

-- put it online - dub / github. 

-- shouldn't have problems getting a good mark 
-- getting a comparison with Ada would be neat.
-- compare 2 things, style of the solution, and the performance. 

-- any proof of correctness type thing to show that what i've got is correct.

-- either a set of guidelines of what can be used in an ATC region, or go in 
and have a look at things that I think would cause problems. Suggest evaluating 
whether they are cancellation safe.

-- ways to modify the runtime to make it safe.
