%\section{General Introduction} % 200 words
This report sets out to detail and discuss the implementation of real-time 
programming capabilities into the D programming language. 
Such support will take the form of a library, allowing a simplistic implementation 
into new programs, without the need to run custom compilers or 
modify the language's runtime. Furthermore, the project has a design 
goal: any existing applications should not be affected through the introduction 
of this library. This means that any code written without prior knowledge should 
remain completely unaffected, unless explicity invoked in a real-time context,
such as during Asynchronous Transfer of Control (ATC). 
\par\bigskip\noindent
The D programming language was chosen as the target for this project due to its 
inherent suitability for many real-time principals. The language shows a rich 
feature set, boasting high-level abstractions, low-level capabilities, 
improved memory safety over C/C++, a safe type 
system, built-in unit-testing, and a general purpose approach 
to programming. Simply stated, D aims to be a ``C++ done right'' \cite{qznc-tutorial}. 
With C++ seeing increasing use on large scale real-time systems, such as the F-35 
fighter jet, it follows a logical progression that D would provide a suitable 
alternative \cite{f35}.

\section{Project Goal} % 200 words? 
This project aims to build upon previous research in the field of real-time systems. 
Significant study has gone into the schedulability of the task sets that 
define a real-time system, as well as different programming languages capabilities 
to provide guaranteed timings \cite{burns-sched-analysis,atc-article}. 
However, the evaluation of a new programming language's suitability for the 
development of real-time systems, and the provision of real-time programming 
abstractions to such a language, is unexplored. 
This project aims to target this omission by extending any necessary 
abstractions to D, detailing its suitability for real-time systems.
% Limitations -- be honest with the limitations of the project, i.e can only
% target certain operating systems, requires glibc, still has a garbage
% collector. 
\section{Limitations} % 200 words? 
Throughout the course of this project, several limitations have been placed on 
D as a programming language for the development of real-time systems. 
This section explains these restrictions, and their reasons.
\subsection{Operating System}
Using D's existing features was a desired requirement for the project. 
D's native approach to concurrency, a \texttt{Thread}, does not provide a
container in which to run. 
Instead, the language provides a wrapper around operating system calls, 
providing the correct type of thread for the target operating system
\cite{github-core-thread}. 
\par\bigskip\noindent
This has the advantage of flexibility with regards to operating system.
Furthermore, it does not require the use of a virtual machine, as seen in languages such as 
Java and C\# \cite{zhang2007exploiting}. However, this comes at a cost of implementation: 
different operating systems handle threads and scheduling very differently. 
In order to provide guaranteed latencies, real-time systems use a priority based 
scheduling approach. This approach is currently only available in D through the use of 
POSIX threads, targeting a POSIX compliant operating system such as GNU/Linux. 
As a result, the functionality provided by the real-time library for D is only 
applicable on a POSIX compliant operating system or one with a binding to the POSIX 
API.

\subsection{External Libraries}

Similar to how D handles threads, many of the language's core features, such as 
mutexes and semaphores, are provided through interaction with external libraries. 
Many of the features implemented in the real-time library depend on the ability 
to interact with a standard C library, such as GlibC. This poses another limitation 
on the project: real-time features are only appropriate on operating systems with 
a standard C library provided. However, the use of C is widespread, and C is 
supported on most operating systems. 

\subsection{Garbage Collector}
A further limitation is provided by D's use of a stop-the-world garbage collector. 
This, at any moment in time, may pause the execution of the entire program in 
order to perform memory management. As providing D with a real-time capable 
garbage collector is outside the scope of this project, an additional limitation 
is imposed. In order to guarantee a timely response, and that no 
deadlines are missed, the garbage collector must either be avoided or memory 
management techniques such as pooling and preallocation must be used instead. 

% Assumptions. -- Assuming that the GC has negligible impact. ? 
\section{Assumptions} 
As D's current garbage-collector does not provide real-time capable
memory-management, it is assumed that the garbage collector will either be replaced, 
avoided, or techniques such as pooling and preallocation will be used so that 
garbage collection does not affect deadlines. 

\section{Statement of Ethics}
While it is unclear how the results of this project may be used, the project 
itself does not contain participants and as such there is no immediate ethical impact.

% Outline of what is to come in this report. 
\section{Report Outline} % 200 words
This report is divided into 5 main sections:
First, a literature review will 
consider existing research, analysing material on 
real-time systems and situating this report within the context of these works. 
From this, a set of requirements for real-time programming will be generated. 
Secondly, a description and analysis of the problem is detailed. This sets out 
the target criteria and an overview of features of the D programming 
language. 
The report will then discuss the approach taken for the implemented library, 
highlighting any decisions made during the library's creation. This section will 
also detail how sample programs may be written using.
The next section, Results and Evaluation, will provide a comparison with an 
existing real-time capable programming language, Ada, as well as a comparison 
between its own two and Ada's implementations of ATC. 
Finally, conclusions will be drawn regarding the following: 
the efficiency and safety of the two implemented ATC methods, 
the effectiveness of real-time systems development in D over an alternative language, 
and the potential D has for developing real-time systems.
