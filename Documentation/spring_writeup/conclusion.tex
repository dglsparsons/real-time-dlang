The D programming language inherently provides a capable set of features for the 
development of real-time systems, such as the ability to interact with low-level 
hardware, powerful concurrency tools, an interesting approach to memory 
safety, and the ability to interact with existing C code. 
However, these alone are not enough to provide the full tool-set required for
the development of a real-time system. 
As such, additional requirements have been explored, discussed, and implemented 
through this project. 
\par\bigskip\noindent
By targeting POSIX compliant operating systems, particularly those that are
real-time operating systems, it is possible to provide tools that enable control 
over the operating systems scheduler. 
This allows priority based scheduling to be used, thus satisfying requirements
1 and 2.
In order to have high precision timings, access to a monotonic clock is provided 
as a language feature. 
This clock can be then used in combination with C
interoperability to provide absolute delay timings through a wrapper around the
\texttt{clock\textunderscore{}nanosleep} function, satisfying requirement 3 and
4. 
In order to provide a bounding on the amount of Priority Inversion that a task
may suffer, both the Priority Inheritance and Priority Ceiling protocols have
been implemented through the languages use of POSIX Mutexes. This meets
requirements 5 and 6. 
For requirement 7, Asynchronous Transfer of Control has been implemented in two 
alternative approaches: a two-thread model, and a one-thread, \texttt{Exception} model. 
This provides the desired functionality, and nicely encapsulates not only
creation and cancellation of an
abortable section, but provides mechanisms for adding cleanup routines and deferring 
cancellation. 
Furthermore, in addition to the provided functionality, a wide range of unit-tests 
have been provided, alongside in-built documentation. 
The unit-tests can easily be invoked to ensure correct operation, and
additionally provide example usage of the provided functionality. 
These implemented tools are provided as a module, and can be made available as 
a library. This would enable the development of real-time system in the D programming 
language, as well as maintaining compatibility with existing code.

\par\bigskip\noindent
However, there are additional difficulties that the 
language faces: the use of a stop-the-world garbage collector in the 
D programming language prevents a reliable estimate of timings from being determined. 
This is a problem that can be offset through disabling the garbage collector 
and instead using manual memory management, or through detaching a thread from the 
runtime and ensuring any GC objects used are referenced from other threads.
Offsetting the penalty of the garbage collector adds additional complexity for 
the programmer and can restrict the use of more advanced language features. 
\par\bigskip\noindent
As such, it is possible to develop a real-time system in the D programming 
language using the additional support detailed in this article. However, 
the Garbage collector remains a significant hurdle in aiding development.
