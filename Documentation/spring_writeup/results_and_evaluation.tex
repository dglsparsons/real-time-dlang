This section sets out to examine the provided library, and how its usage
compares syntactically to the development of a real-time system in Ada. 
Following on from
this, a comparison in terms of efficiency will be made with Ada. Furthermore,
the efficiency of the two implementations of Asynchronous Transfer of Control in 
D will be examined. 

% Appreciate the latent issues of the subject area (for example, 
% in software engineering they might meet and tackle such as emergent requirements, 
% design flaws, equipment/application problems). Examined in the project 
% design/implementation and evaluation chapters. 
\section{Comparison with Ada}

This section sets to compare the implementation of real-time primitives in D,
with those of Ada, a general purpose programming language with a wide range of
support for real-time systems.

\section{Efficiency of Implementation vs Ada}
% Compare D with Ada in terms of efficiency.
In order to form a true comparison between the two languages, D and Ada, it is
necessary to examine their performance.

\section{Comparison of Asynchronous Transfer of Control Approaches}
% Profile the two ATC Methods.
