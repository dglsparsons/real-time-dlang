The development of Real-Time systems typically involves the use of a programming 
language providing explicit support for any necessary primitives, such as 
Asynchronous Transfer of Control and Priority Inversion. 
Many programming languages exist that provide this level of support: the most 
notable examples being Real-Time Java, Ada and C with POSIX Threads. However, 
there is no reason that this pool of applicable languages can not be extended to 
incorporate new, powerful programming languages. 
D is one such language, aiming for a C++ style syntax, coupled with powerful 
abstractions to ease development and the ability to take advantage of modern 
compiler technology in order to provide aggressively optimised code.
The D programming language is of particular interest for 
the development of Real-Time applications due to it's combined ease of development
and inherent ability to access low-level functionality.
\par\bigskip\noindent
However, it is noteworthy that D does not provide support for Real-Time systems: 
it has required characteristics of enabling concurrent programming and low-level 
control, but lacks required primitives. 
In order to develop a Real-Time application or system, additional functionality 
must therefore be provided.
This project intends to contribute to the pool of languages supporting the development 
of Real-Time systems and applications by providing necessary primitives and 
to the D Programming language.
