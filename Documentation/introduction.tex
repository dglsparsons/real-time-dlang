The development of Real-Time systems typically involves the use of a programming 
language providing explicit support for necessary primitives such as Asynchronous 
Transfer of Control and Priority Inversion. 
Many programming languages exist that provide this level of support.
Notable example include Java, Ada and C with POSIX Threads. This enables the 
development of Real-Time applications and systems.
However, newer programming languages also exist. These enable a developer to 
simultaneously take powerful abstractions and take advantage of aggressive 
compiler optimisation. The D programming language is of particular interest for 
the development of Real-Time applications due to it's combined ease of development
and natural ability to access low level functionality.
\par\bigskip\noindent
However, it is noteworthy that D does not provide support for Real-Time systems: 
in order to develop a Real-Time application or system, additional functionality 
must therefore be provided.
This project intends to contribute to the pool of languages supporting the development 
of Real-Time systems and applications by providing necessary primitives and 
abstractions to the D Programming language.
