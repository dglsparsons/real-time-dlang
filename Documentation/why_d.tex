This sections aims to outline the reasons for using D as a programming language,
specifically in regard to Real Time systems. 

\subsection{Powerful}
% Aims to achieve everything that is possible with other languages such as C++
% Contains high level abstractions

\subsection{Low Level Capabilities}
% Despite high level implementation and powerful abstractions, enables low
% level control as needed.

\subsection{Idiomatic}
% Goal of the language designers is to be able to have code that is easy to
% write, easy to read and understand.

\subsection{Memory Safe Programming}
% Concept of memory safe programming that D supports.

\subsection{Unittesting}
% Idea of built in tests, contract programming, debugging, error handling

\subsection{Compile Time Checks}
% Strong type checking, deprecating obselete APIs, Range checking on arrays,
% etc.
